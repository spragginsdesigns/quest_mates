	clerkId: string;
	username: string;
	avatarUrl: string;
	timezone: string;
	birthday: Date;
	createdAt: Date;
	updatedAt: Date;
}

// Gaming Preferences
interface GamingPreferences {
	userId: string;
	favoriteGenres: string[];
	platforms: string[];
	playStyle: "Casual" | "Competitive" | "Both";
	favoriteGames: string[];
	availability: {
		weekday: TimeRange[];
		weekend: TimeRange[];
	};
}

// Social Preferences
interface SocialPreferences {
	userId: string;
	voiceChatPreference: "Always" | "Sometimes" | "Never";
	languages: string[];
	teamSize: "Solo" | "Small" | "Large";
	contentCreator: boolean;
}
```

### Implementation Order

```

## Current Development Focus

Moving from landing page to authentication and profile creation, focusing on creating an engaging and intuitive user onboarding experience.

## Development Guidelines

- Prioritize performance and mobile responsiveness
- Maintain clean, well-documented code
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Regular Git commits with meaningful messages
- Testing for critical user flows
- Always add "use client" directive for components using client-side features
- Ensure proper version compatibility between packages

## Notes and Ideas

- Consider implementing a "gaming personality" quiz for better matches
- Explore integration with gaming platforms' APIs
- Plan for scalability and user growth
- Consider adding voice chat capabilities for matched users
- Keep track of package version compatibility
- Document all client-side components and their dependencies
